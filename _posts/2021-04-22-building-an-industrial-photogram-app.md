In App Dev 1, one of the big key projects we worked on was Photogram, a photo-sharing platform akin to Instagram. Looking back, I thought it was a challenging project
because we were making a social media app as a culmination of the Ruby on Rails topics we had learned up to that point, including sessions, forms, and conditionals.

Now, we revisited this project, and our goal was to make it an industrial-grade application.
